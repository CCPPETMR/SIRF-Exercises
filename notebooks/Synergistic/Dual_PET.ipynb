    "# The challenge!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an open-ended look into using de Pierro MAPEM to reconstruct a dual-PET acquisition with motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine two different scans (FDG and amyloid) were performed in a short space of time on a single patient. \n",
    "- Your task is to implement an alternating reconstruction of the two scans using de Pierro's MAPEM algorithm!\n",
    "- Bear in mind that the two scans weren't performed at the same time, so the patient's head isn't necessarily in the same place...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since we can't be sure of patient position, you should probably reconstruct each image individually \n",
    "2. Then register them\n",
    "3. Then implement de Pierro's algorithm with two regularisation images\n",
    "4. Make sure that the regularisation images are in the correct space. For this, you'll probably need to do some resampling!\n",
    "\n",
    "For registration and resampling, check out the [../Reg/sirf_registration.ipynb](../Reg/sirf_registration.ipynb) notebook.  \n",
    "For an implementation of de Pierro MAPEM, checkout the [de_Pierro_MAPEM.ipynb](de_Pierro_MAPEM.ipynb) notebook."
